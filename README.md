 A Java console application that generates a random melody within a given musical scale with a user-defined length.
 
 Planned Future Changes: 
 <br>1. Reformat code to use do loops for input validation, instead of while loops
 <br>2. Consider using database to hold scale and note information instead of hard-coded switch statement
 <br>3. Add support for MIDI output
 <br>3. Create and implement basic GUI
 <br>4. Consider converting program into a VST Plug in for DAW support
